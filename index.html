              A healthy way to change things up in November.
            </p>

            <p>It's simple. Don't drink the following during the month of November:</p>
            <p>
              - Caffeine<br>
              - Alchohol<br>
              - The Internet Firehose
            </p>

            <p>Enjoy the detox. Raise awareness for mental health.</p>

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p class="lead">What inspired this?</p>
          <p>In NYC, I liked to raise money for a cause I care about by running for <a href="http://www.weare.ci/"><mark>C/I</mark></a> in November. I moved and I can't grow a moustache. It got me thinking of other ways to challenge myself for a month. Considering all the tasks that go into a move (or any big change), a detox sounded like a good way to clear the mind. It seemed fitting to partner it with mental health.</p>

          <p class="lead">Why remove these three things?</p>
          <p>For the better part of a decade I’ve trained myself into giving small rewards for small tasks. I wake up every morning, plan the day or excercise, and then reward myself with coffee. Through the day, I complete various tasks, and reward myself with checking random internet feeds. At the end of the day I grab a drink or two for a job well done. I wake up the next day, and I have my coffee. And so life marches on, and you get the idea.</p>
          <p>Individually, these rewards are harmless, even necessary. As Pavlovian reactions, I'm not so sure. So, I’m curious — what happens when I remove the easy ways that I reward myself for every day accomplishments? Will my focus and productivity improve? Will my relationships change? Will healthier decisions be easier to make, physically and mentally? How much money will I save?</p>

          <p class="lead">What's the Internet Firehose?</p>
          <p>Basically any social service with a scrolling feed that I habitually check - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Swarm, etc. They're kinda like the junk food of social interaction. High calorie count (time suck), low nutritional value (shallow interactions).</p>

          <p class="lead">What social Internet Things are okay to use?</p>
          <p>Messenger services that are meant for one on one or small group conversation - Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Slack, etc. - and email.</p>

          <p class="lead">Where's the money going? Why?</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.preventioninstitute.org/"><mark>The Prevention Institute</mark></a>. They are a Movember partner working on mental health and that seemed like a good place to start. I would love to hear about other charities that would be a good match. Please <a href=mailto:jakedsimms@gmail.com?Subject="NoDrinkNovember%20Charity"><mark>tell me</mark></a> about any good ones. Especially any near LA.</p>

          <p class="lead">How do I donate? / What's Crowdrise?</p>
          <p>I setup donations to go through a service called Crowdrise, a super sweet company that handles getting all the money to the charity so you or I don't have to worry about it. Once you are on the <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/nodrinknovember/"><mark>NoDrinkNovember Crowdrise page</mark></a> there will be <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0w0T1g3Z1x1J"><mark>a big "Donate" button</mark></a>. Use it :)</p>

          <p class="lead">How do I participate?</p>
          <p>First, <a href="mailto:jakedsimms@gmail.com?Subject=NoDrinkNovember%20Participant"><mark>email me</mark></a>. I can give you a little blurb to send around and I'd love to have your contact info to see how it went at the end of the November. If you don't want to talk to me, that's cool, you can also just sign up on <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/nodrinknovember/"><mark>Crowdrise</mark></a>. There's <a href="http://cl.ly/image/1N0E3G0g3u26"><mark>a join fundraise button</mark></a> on the campaign's main page.</p>
          <p>Second, swear off coffee, soda, tea, and booze. Uninstall anything with a feed (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Swarm, etc.) and only use messengers (Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Snapchat, etc.) or email to interact with friends. Bring up what you're doing in conversations. Ask for a donation or two. Enjoy the detox.</p>
