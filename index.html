          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p class="lead">What inspired this?</p>
          <p>I moved. A short detox sounded like a good way to bring focus during the adjustment. <!--I felt this effort ties in nicely with mental health and wellness.--></p>

          <p class="lead">Why remove these three things for a month?</p>
          <p>For the better part of a decade I’ve trained myself into giving small rewards for small tasks. I wake up every morning, plan the day or excercise, and then reward myself with coffee. Through the day, I complete various tasks, and reward myself with checking random internet feeds. At the end of the day I grab a drink or two for a job well done. I wake up the next day, and I have my coffee. And so life marches on, and you get the idea.</p>
          <p>Individually, these rewards are harmless, even necessary. As Pavlovian reactions, I'm not so sure. So, I’m curious — what happens when I remove the easy ways that I reward myself for every day accomplishments? Will my focus and productivity improve? Will my relationships change? Will healthier decisions be easier to make, physically and mentally? How much money will I save?</p>

          <p class="lead">What's the Internet Firehose?</p>
          <p>Any social service with a scrolling feed that I habitually check - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. They're kinda like the junk food of social interaction. High calorie count (time suck), low nutritional value (shallow interactions).</p>

          <p class="lead">What's okay to use?</p>
          <p>Messenger services that are meant for one on one or small group conversation - Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Slack, etc. - and email.</p>

          <!--
          <p class="lead">Where's the money going? Why?</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.preventioninstitute.org/"><mark>The Prevention Institute</mark></a>. They already partner with Movember and that seemed like a good place to start. If you know any LA charities that are a good match, please <a href=mailto:jakedsimms@gmail.com?Subject="NoDrinkNovember%20Charity"><mark>tell me</mark></a>.</p>

          <p class="lead">How do I donate? / What's Crowdrise?</p>
          <p>I setup donations to go through a service called Crowdrise, a super sweet company that handles getting all the money to the charity so you or I don't have to worry about it. Once you are on the <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/nodrinknovember/"><mark>NoDrinkNovember Crowdrise page</mark></a> there will be <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0w0T1g3Z1x1J"><mark>a big "Donate" button</mark></a>. Use it :)</p>
          -->

          <p class="lead">How do I participate?</p>
          <p>First, <a href="mailto:jakedsimms@gmail.com?Subject=NoDrinkNovember%20Participant"><mark>email me</mark></a>. I'd love to have your contact info to see how it went at the end of the November.</p>
          <p>Second, swear off coffee, soda, tea, and booze. Uninstall anything with a feed (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Swarm, etc.) and only use messengers (Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Snapchat, etc.) or email to interact with friends and family. <!--Bring up what you're doing in conversations. Ask for a donation or two.--> Enjoy the detox.</p>
