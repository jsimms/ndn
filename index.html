No Drink November

**WHAT
 No Drink November is a month long excercise where I don't drink:

1. Caffiene
2. Alchohol
3. From the "Internet Firehose"

Sounds healthy, doesn't it?

**HOW DOES THIS WORK.
YOU pledge to donate X amount of dollars every day I'm succesful in 'not drinking'.
I in turn. Don't drink. The stakes help make this more than an excercise in self-restraint.

It's easy. Fill out this form. I'll send an email at the end of each week on how successul I was.
At the end of the month, your card will be charged and money will be donated to: Camp Interactive

I'm keeping none of it outside of covering any processing expenses, which should hover around % or $$

**WHY
I don't look good trying to grow a moustache.

I figured I could filp this movember thing a bit and try to earn a little money
for a good cause while doing something good for myself.

**YEAH, BUT WHY
The fundraising part is pretty self explanitory, so I'm guessing why cut out those three things.

The answer is rewards. For the better part of a decade, every day I wake up, I drink coffee.
Through the day, I complete various tasks, and reward myself. Finish a jog, get a coffee.
Complete this work task, check Facebook/Instagram/Twitter and release a little notification dopamine. Compelte another work tasks, grab a coffee.
At the end of that day filled with other rewards, I pat myself on the back for a job well done
and grab a beer, or two, or three. I wake up the next day, and I have my coffee.

Individually, these things are harmless, even necessary. I'm just simply curious -
what happens when I remove all the easy ways to reward myself for day to day wins?

Will I see improvements to my physical health? My mental health?
Will I be more engaged in the present or will I loose touch?
Will my relationships suffer or improve?
Will I have more time, or less time?
Will I spend less money?
Will I take on more difficult projects? Will I complete those projects more effeciently?
Will my motivations move to be more intrinsic, or will I find different ways to reward myself?
If those rewards are bigger, longer term? Will I begin to think, bigger, longer term and be happier with the present?

I don't know!

**HERE'S WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN
After a week of painful detox, I'll spend less money, I'll be just as social,
I'll be more engaged in the conversations I do have, and I'll be more informed of world news.
I'll think longer term with rewards, and plan my days and weeks better, do things I intrinsically enjoy more,
and will take on the stuff I don't like as much more quickly and effectively so I can get it out of the way.

**WHAT EXACTLY IS THE INTERNET FIREHOSE
It may be easier to start with what I WON'T give up. I'll keep WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Snapchat.
I'll be present and connected, but more on a 1on1 or small group level.

Whay I'm giving up are the bottomless feeds and services I'll use as a 'reward.'

That means for sure no Facebook, Twitter, & Instagram. I'll also nix Reddit even though I don't post.
It also means no dating apps (a match is a similar reward to getting a like). No Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, etc.

Content sites are trickier. Yes, you can spend a lot of time on Buzzfeed, ESPN, and yes,
they scroll seemingly endlessly. I'll allow them this year. It'll be interesting to see if I
I use them the same or they become replacements.

**WHEN WILL YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW IT ALL WENT
I'll do those quick summaries at the end of the week, and I'll do one big one at the end.
Probably a medium post. Because Internet.

**DON'T OVERTHINK THIS
This is a terrible 'experiment' setup. I don't have a control group for a lot of these questions. 
I'm trying three behavioral changes instead of one, and one is a big gray area.

This isn't meant to be perfect experiment.

It's meant to raise a little money for the kids and try something that might help me learn more about myself.

**WHO AM I
Right...I'm Jake. I just moved to Los Angeles, and no, I don't think I'm a masochist
for cutting out coffee and alcohol while trying to learn a new city and meet new people.

I'm around the internet here, here, here, and here - but you won't see me there until December.

**WHO IS C/I
They are good people. They are trying to inspire the next generation of tech leaders in NYC.

You can find them here, here, here, and here.
